### ChrtGPT

- Chat automatically scrolls-to-bottom when new messages are added
  - The DOM-based chat components were replaced by virtualized chat components and scrolling logic was set up
- Chats persist within a single session after navigating to another route and back
  - A custom React Context API provider component and consumer hook were created. With this approach, a React Context can be created with no default value while preventing nullish type reference errors in TypeScript context consumers - without the need for optional chaining.
  - The context provider was mounted higher up in the component tree to make it accessible throughout the application.
