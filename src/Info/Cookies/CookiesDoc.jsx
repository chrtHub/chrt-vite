      <p>
        Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored
        on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.
        They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for
        a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat
        visits (using a “persistent cookie”). Cookies may be set by the site
        that you are visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or by third
        parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or
        analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”).
