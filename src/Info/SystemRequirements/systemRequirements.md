# Minimum System Requirements

### Browser Software

- **Modern web browser.** The newest stable release of a Chromium-based browser, ideally Google Chrome, but including Mozilla Firefox and Brave Browser
  - **Other modern browsers** may be used, but will not receive debugging support from CHRT. We develop software for Chromium-based browsers, so those generally have the best performance.
  - **Mobile browsers** are not the intended target for our browser software products, but may be used, although they will not receive debugging Support from CHRT.
- **Computer system.** A computer system which meets the system requirements of stated modern web browser
- **Internet connection.** At least 5 Mbps (megabits per second) internet connection. A slower connection may lead to poor user experience. A faster connection may lead to better performance. We recommend an internet connection exceeding 100 Mbps.
- **Display.** Modern computer display with a resolution of at least 1920 x 1080 pixels
- **Inputs.** Standard modern keyboard and mouse inputs

### Mobile Application Software [expected Q2 2023]

- **Android.** Systems meeting the minimum system requirements for the latest major release of the Android platform.
- **iPhone.** Systems meeting the minimum system requirements for the latest major release of the iOS platform.

### Desktop Software

- Currently we deliver our software via web browsers and mobile applications, but we could develop a downloadable version for modern systems such as MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Web browsers offer many benefits to users and developers, but if you have a strong preference for downloadable desktop software, please contact us at (support [at] chrt [dot] com) with the subject like "please develop downloadable desktop software".

### Failure to meet system requirements

- In general, using a system that does not meet these requirements will result in a poor user experience. In some cases, the software will be inaccesible or inoperable.
- If you can use a device to access this page and our homepage at [chrt.com](https://chrt.com), it's very likely, but not guaranteed, that the device meets our minimum system requirements.
- Exceptions may include (1) certain low-performance mobile devices and (2) tablets or devices not intended for accessing web applications.
