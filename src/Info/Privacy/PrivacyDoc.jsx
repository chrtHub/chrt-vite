        Under the CCPA, a business that sells California residents&#39; personal

      </p>
      <h3 id="your-rights-under-the-ccpa">Your rights under the CCPA</h3>
      <p>
        The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights related to
        their personal information. To submit a request based on these rights,
        please contact us at (support [at] CHRT [dot] com) with the subject line
        &quot;CCPA rights request&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        When receiving a request, we will verify that the individual making the
        request is the resident to whom the personal information subject to the
        request pertains. California residents may exercise their rights
        themselves or may use an authorized agent, designated in writing or
        through a power of attorney, to make requests on their behalf. If you
        use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require that you
        provide us additional information demonstrating that the agent is acting
        on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly
        with us. With respect to your personal information, California residents
        may exercise the rights described below.
      </p>
      <h4 id="right-to-know-">Right to Know.</h4>

      <h4 id="right-to-opt-out-">Right to Opt-Out.</h4>
      <p>
        You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information.

        CCPA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your
        CCPA rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an
        authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights
        under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will
        require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your
        behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
        Further, to provide or delete specific pieces of personal information we
        will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by
        law. We will verify your request by asking you to submit the request
        from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to
        provide information necessary to verify your account. Please note that
        you may use two-factor authentication with your CHRT account. Finally,
        you have a right to receive notice of our practices at or before
        collection of personal information.
