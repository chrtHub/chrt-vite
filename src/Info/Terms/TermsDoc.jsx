        <li>
          <strong>Product changes.</strong> CHRT has the right to make changes

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Affiliates.</strong> Customer’s Affiliates may use the

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance with laws.</strong> Customer’s use of the Products

        <li>
          <strong>Reservation of rights.</strong> Products are protected by
          copyright and other intellectual property laws and international

            <li>
              install, use, or distribute other software or technology in any

              subject to any other license terms;
            </li>
            <li>

      <h3 id="b-data-protection">B. Data Protection</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Data.</strong> Customer and CHRT will comply with
          applicable data protection laws.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="c-confidentiality">C. Confidentiality</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Existing NDA.</strong> If the parties have entered into a
          non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of this
          confidentiality section.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confidential Information.</strong> “Confidential Information”
          is non-public information in any form that is marked as “confidential”
          or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This
          includes, but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this
          Agreement and Customer’s account authentication credentials.
          Confidential Information does not include information that which:
          <ol>
            <li>
              becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality
              obligation;
            </li>
            <li>
              was received lawfully from another source without a
              confidentiality obligation;
            </li>
            <li>is independently developed; or</li>
            <li>is Feedback.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> Each party
          will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s Confidential
          Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential
          Information as part of the parties’ business relationship. Neither
          party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A party
          may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives
          on a need-to-know basis, under nondisclosure obligations at least as
          protective as this Agreement. Each party remains responsible for the
          use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must
          promptly notify the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use
          or disclosure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disclosure required by law.</strong> A party may disclose the
          other’s Confidential Information if required by law, but only after it
          notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other
          party can seek a protective order.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Residual information.</strong> Neither party is required to
          restrict its Representatives in other work assignments if they have
          had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use
          of information retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the
          development or deployment of the parties’ respective products or
          services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade
          secret law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Duration of confidentiality obligation.</strong> These
          confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content, until it
          is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other
          Confidential Information, for a period of five years after a party
          receives the Confidential Information.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="d-warranties">D. Warranties</h3>
      <ol>

          <strong>Limited warranties and remedies.</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Online Services.</strong> CHRT warrants that the Online
              Services will perform in accordance with the applicable SLA during
              Customer’s use. Customer’s remedies for breach of this warranty
              are described in the SLA. If no SLA is provided, no warranty is
              conferred.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Software.</strong> CHRT warrants that the Online Service
              software will perform substantially as described in the applicable
              Product documentation for the duration of a Customer&#39;s
              Subscription License for that Online Service. If it does not and
              Customer notifies CHRT within the warranty term, CHRT will at its
              option (a) return the price Customer paid for the software
              license, (b) return the pro-rated (at a daily interval and
              beginning on the day of Customer&#39;s notice to CHRT) price
              Customer paid for the remainder of the term of the software
              license, or (c) repair or replace the software.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exclusions.</strong> The warranties in this Agreement do not
          apply to problems caused by accident, abuse, or use inconsistent with
          this Agreement, including failure to meet minimum system requirements.
          These warranties do not apply to Previews.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disclaimer.</strong> Except for the limited warranties above
          and subject to applicable law, CHRT provides no other warranties. It
          disclaims any other express, implied or statutory warranties,
          including warranties of quality, title, non-infringement,
          merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.

      </ol>

      <h3 id="e-third-party-claims">E. Third party claims</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The parties will defend each other against third party claims
          described in this section and will pay the amount of any resulting
          adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the
          defending party is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has
          the right to control the defense and any settlement of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The party being defended must provide the defending party with all
          requested assistance, information, and authority. The defending party
          will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
          expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.
        </li>
        <li>
          This section describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability
          for such claims.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>By CHRT.</strong> CHRT will defend Customer against any
              third-party claim that a Product made available by CHRT for a fee
              and used within the scope of this Agreement (unmodified as
              provided by CHRT and not combined with anything else),
              misappropriated a trade secret or directly infringes a patent,
              copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party.
              If CHRT is unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or
              infringement, it may, at its option, either (1) modify or replace
              the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate
              Customer’s license and refund any license fees (either in full or
              pro-rated at a daily interval and beginning on the day of
              Customer&#39;s notice to CHRT), including amounts paid in advance
              for any usage period after the termination date. CHRT will not be
              liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued use
              of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party
              claim.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>By Customer.</strong> To the extent permitted by
              applicable law, Customer will defend CHRT and its Affiliates
              against any third-party claim that: (1) any Customer Content
              misappropriated a trade secret or directly infringes a patent,
              copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party;
              or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with
              anything else, violates the law or harms a third party.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="f-limitation-of-liability">F. Limitation of liability</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Each party’s maximum, aggregate liability to the other under this
          Agreement is limited to direct damages finally awarded in an amount
          not to exceed the following:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Products.</strong> For Products ordered on a subscription
              basis, CHRT&#39;s maximum liability to Customer for any incident
              giving rise to a claim will not exceed the amount Customer paid
              for the Product during the 12 months before the incident.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Previews.</strong> For Previews, CHRT&#39;s maximum
              liability is limited to US $500 or the amount paid by Customer to
              CHRT during the 12 months before the incident, whichever is lower.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exclusions.</strong> In no event will either party be
              liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or
              consequential damages, or loss of use, loss of profits, or
              interruption of business; however caused or on any theory of
              liability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exceptions.</strong> No limitation or exclusions will
              apply to liability arising out of either party’s (1)
              confidentiality obligations (except for liability related to
              Customer Content, which is subject to the above limitation for
              Products); (2) defense obligations above; or (3) violation of the
              other party’s intellectual property rights.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="g-pricing-and-payment">G. Pricing and payment</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Fees.</strong> Customer agrees to pay fees in full, up front
          and, if invoiced, within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Amounts
          payable are non-refundable, except as stated in this Agreement
          regarding Product warranty and third-party claims. If billed based on
          usage, CHRT will invoice according to the billing model described in
          the Product documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Late payment.</strong> If Customer fails to pay fees on time,
          CHRT has the right to charge 2% monthly interest on past due amounts
          as allowed by law. CHRT also has the right to charge Customer for all
          expenses of recovery, to terminate the applicable order, turn off
          access, and to take any other action at law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Taxes.</strong> Customer is solely responsible for all taxes,
          fees, duties, and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on
          CHRT&#39;s net income) that are imposed or become due in connection
          with this Agreement. If any taxes are required to be withheld on
          payments invoiced by CHRT, Customer may deduct such taxes from the
          amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority, but only
          if Customer promptly provides CHRT an official receipt for those
          withholdings and other documents reasonably requested to allow CHRT to
          claim a foreign tax credit or refund. Customer will ensure that any
          taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable
          law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="h-term-and-termination">H. Term and termination</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement is effective until terminated by
          a party, as described below.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Termination without cause.</strong> Either party may terminate
          this Agreement without cause on 30 days’ notice. Licenses granted on a
          subscription basis will continue for the duration of the Subscription
          Term, subject to the terms of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Termination for cause.</strong> Without limiting other
          remedies, either party may terminate this Agreement for material
          breach immediately if the other party fails to cure a curable breach
          within a 30-day notice period. Upon such termination:
          <ol>
            <li>
              All licenses granted under this Agreement will terminate
              immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              All amounts due under any unpaid invoices will become due and
              payable immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              If CHRT is in breach, Customer will be reimbursed for any prepaid
              unused fees.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Termination for regulatory reasons.</strong> CHRT may modify,
          discontinue, or terminate a Product in any country or jurisdiction
          where there is any current or future government regulation,
          obligation, or other requirement, that (1) is not generally applicable
          to businesses operating there; (2) presents a hardship for CHRT to
          continue offering the Product without modification; or (3) causes CHRT
          to believe these terms or the Product may conflict with any such
          regulation, obligation, or requirement. If CHRT terminates a
          subscription for regulatory reasons, Customer will receive, as its
          sole remedy, a reimbursement for any prepaid, unused subscription
          fees.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="i-miscellaneous">I. Miscellaneous</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Independent contractors.</strong> The parties are independent
          contractors. Customer and CHRT may develop products independently
          without using the other’s Confidential Information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amendments.</strong> CHRT may require Customer to accept
          revised or additional terms before processing a new order. Any
          additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer
          are expressly rejected and will not apply.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Order of precedence.</strong> Conflicting terms in the Product
          Specific Terms take precedence over these General Terms as to the
          applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section G
          &quot;Pricing and payment&quot; and Section I.11 &quot;Applicable law
          and venue&quot; by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
          Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other
          documents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assignment.</strong> Either party may assign this Agreement to
          an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in writing of the
          assignment. CHRT may also assign its rights to receive payment and
          enforce Customer’s payment obligations. Any other assignment of this

          <strong>Compliance with trade laws.</strong> The parties acknowledge
          that the Products may be subject to U.S. and other countries’ export
          jurisdictions. Each party will comply with all laws and regulations
          applicable to the import or export of the Products, including, but not
          limited to, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, International
          Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by
          the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer
          will not take any action that causes CHRT to violate U.S. or other
          applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of
          trade laws relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a
          potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it will alert
          CHRT as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after
          acquiring this knowledge. CHRT may suspend or terminate this Agreement
          to the extent that it reasonably concludes that performance would
          cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including
          those described above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of
          economic sanctions under such trade laws.
